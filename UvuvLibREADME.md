UvuvLib is a library intended to just do everything humanely possible to get you to where you need to go.

This library includes several other libraries (no need to install), such sa Fido, Graphy, and others. 
All will be linked below for due credit. Some I leave plain as is like Fido, others like Graphy
I build off of to make better and more useful.
